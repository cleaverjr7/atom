 # Property list support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to [plist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list)
files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate)
from the [Property List TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/property-list.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
