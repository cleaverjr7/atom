## Usage
You can open the Settings View by navigating to _Atom > Preferences_ (Mac), _File > Preferences_ (Windows), or _Edit > Preferences_ (Linux).

In order to install new packages and themes, click on the _Install_ section on the left-hand side.
Once installed, community packages/themes (and their settings) are housed within their respective section.
All packages/themes that have updates will be listed under the _Updates_ section.  Finally, all keybindings (including ones that community packages have added) are available in the _Keybindings_ section.
