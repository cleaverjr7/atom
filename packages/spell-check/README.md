# Spell Check Package

Highlights misspelling in Atom and shows possible corrections.

Use `cmd:` to bring up the list of corrections when your cursor in on a
misspelled word.

By default spell check is enabled for the following files:

* Plain Text
* GitHub Markdown
* Git Commit Message

You can override this from the _Spell Check_ settings in the Settings view
(`cmd-,`).
