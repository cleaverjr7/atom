# git package

To put a git in some atoms.

## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:atom/git.git
cd git
apm install
apm link -d
atom .

cd ../some-dir-with-a-git-repo
atom -d
```

## Development

* `npm run lint` — Lint the codes.
* `npm run check` — Type check the codes.
* `npm run start` — Start Flow in the background. This will let it parse and typecheck incrementally which is much faster for local development.
* `npm run stop` — Stop Flow.

We're using [Flow](http://flowtype.org) to add T Y P E S.
