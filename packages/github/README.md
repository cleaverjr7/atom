## Current Status

This package is currently :construction: under heavy development. :construction: While its existence isn't a secret, we've chosen not to share that we're working on it with the public quite yet to avoid the too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen problem. Please constrain conversation about this package to the #atom-maintainers room and other private GitHub channels.
