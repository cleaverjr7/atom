I know that this stuff probably doesn't sound fun and breezy or grandly
inspirational. What it is, so far as I can see, is the truth with a whole lot of
rhetorical bullshit pared away. Obviously, you can think of it whatever you
wish. But please don't dismiss it as some finger-wagging Dr. Laura sermon.
None of this is about morality, or religion, or dogma, or big fancy questions of
life after death. The capital- T Truth is about life before death. It is about
making it to 30, or maybe 50, without wanting to shoot yourself in the head. It
is about simple awareness â€” awareness of what is so real and essential, so
hidden in plain sight all around us, that we have to keep reminding ourselves,
over and over: "This is water, this is water."

It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive, day in and day
out.

The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and
discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for
them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day. That is real freedom.
That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is
unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense
of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.
