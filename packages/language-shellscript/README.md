 # ShellScript language support in Atom
![CI Status](https://github.com/atom/language-shellscript/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to shell scripts in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate) from the [ShellScript TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/shellscript.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
