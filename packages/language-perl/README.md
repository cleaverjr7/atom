 # Perl language support in Atom
[![CI](https://github.com/atom/language-perl/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/atom/language-perl/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Perl files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate) from the [Perl TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/perl.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
